# Flutter Fetch Data From Internet

This repository contains the source code of a Flutter application. The main purpose of this app is to serve as a study case for how to fetch data from a REST APIâ€”in this case, the [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) service which provides fake online REST APIs for testing and prototyping.

## Features

- Fetches a list of To-Do items from the JSONPlaceholder API.
- Displays data in a modern Flutter user interface using ListView and Material Design.
- Handles loading states and error messages.
- Uses asynchronous programming (Futures and async/await) to manage data fetching.
- A clear separation of concerns with models, services, and UI components.

## Usage

This app is ideal for beginners who want to learn:
- How to perform HTTP requests in Flutter.
- How to parse JSON data into Dart objects.
- Best practices for state management with setState in simple apps.
- How to display dynamic data in a user-friendly way.

## Getting Started

To run this project, make sure you have Flutter installed. Then:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies.
3. Run `flutter run` to launch the application on your emulator or device.

This project is educational and can be used as a template for learning how to build Flutter apps that interact with remote APIs.
